# LAN PARTY Proof of Concept

Proof-of-concept for a WebRTC connection between two browser pages in the same Local Area Network (LAN).

Goal: Provide serverless WebRTC (no need for signal server / relay servers) for LAN gaming parties.

- Can just use messaging apps to do signalling.
- Relay not needed in most LAN setups.
